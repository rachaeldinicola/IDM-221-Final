	<p>I am a student at Drexel University concentrating in Marketing and Business Analytics with a minor in Interactive Digital Media. I am currently a 5th year senior and will be graduating in March 2018. I am passionate about using my creativity any time I get the chance, which is a nice balance to my data-driven, solution-finding character that I have discovered during my 3 internships these past few years. My creativity and analytical skills are the reason I chose Marketing, Business Analytics, and Interactive Digital Media, as they are the perfect combination for me to pursue a career that I will find challenging, yet enjoyable.</p>
	<p>My career goals as of now are to continue down the road of Paid Search. I currently work at Publicis Health Media as a Paid Search Associate, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far. I am also passionate about social entrepreneurship and hope to start a self-sustaining enterprise that is related to digital marketing and search, while helping those who do not have as many resources as we do.</p>
	<p>At Drexel University, I have done my best to stay involved in order to find what it is that I want to do after college, as well as find organizations that I am passionate about and find other students I have common interests with. A few organizations I have been a part of are:</p>
		<ul class=Activities>
			<li>Alpha Kappa Psi &mdash; Co-ed Professional Business Fraternity</li>
			<li>The Triangle &mdash; Drexel&apos;s Student-Run Newspaper</li>
			<li>Business Learning Community Legacy Program</li>
			<li>Delta Zeta Sorority</li>
			<li>LeBow&apos;s &ldquo;Camp Business&rdquo; Student Ambassador</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Freshman year of college, I went out on a whim and decided to join Alpha Kappa Psi, the co-ed professional business fraternity. I learned an incredible amount of professional tips, interview skills, resume development, and so much more. One of the greatest parts about Alpha Kappa Psi is that it is not just a professional fraternity, but one where you make lifelong friends and an enormous network of current and past brothers who both motivate and encourage you to reach for your goals. I have been Director of Marketing for almost 2 years, and I have enjoyed running our social media (Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr), as well as creating flyers for our events.</p>
	<p>Later on, I joined The Triangle, which is Drexel University&apos;s student-run newspaper. In order to publish articles with no limits or rules, The Triangle was not funded by the school. In order to get money to print the newspaper, host the website, the business department would run local advertisements in the paper and on the website. I was a part of this department with a few other students. We called local food companies and various other local companies in order to fill ad space in the newspaper. I set up a grasshopper account in order for us to receive voicemails that go right to our cell phones, and I learned a lot about print advertising.</p>
	<p>Freshman year of college, I was a part of the Business Learning Community, which is essentially a community of students who live together on the same floor in a residence hall, take the same classes, and do various professional activities throughout the year. Since this program is only for freshman, I joined the legacy program, where I am able to mentor current freshman and attend events that are planned. I served on the executive board, where I helped plan fundraising events and generate other ideas for service, fundraising, professional, etc. Although I am no longer on the executive board, I still remain a mentor helping freshman who are struggling with their adjustment to life in college.</p>
	<p>I recently joined Delta Zeta Sorority, where I have met an incredible group of girls. I have learned a lot from this organization&mdash; mostly that of time management and planning. Having many events going on throughout the term, I found myself planning out my days to the hour, which improved my grades. I served as our social chair, where I planned events with other organizations, which was a great opportunity to meet other people and gain experience in event planning.</p>
	<p>The only summer break I had off of school, I spent back at Drexel for LeBow College of Business&apos; &ldquo;Camp Business&rdquo; as a Student Ambassador. For one month, 3 other students and I acted as the liaisons between LeBow faculty and the high school students who attended the camp. We were required to plan events, ensure the students got to their daily classes, and aided the faculty in anything that was needed.</p>
