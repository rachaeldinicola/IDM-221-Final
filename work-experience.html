	<h2>Publicis Health Media</h2>
	<h3>Paid Search Associate</h3>
	<h4>September 2016 &mdash; Present</h4>
		<p>Publicis Health Media is a media agency solely focused on the health and wellness space. It is a part of the Publicis Groupe network, which is headquartered in Paris, France. In the Philadelphia office, I worked as a Paid Search Associate (co-op), working on mostly Janssen brands. My tasks included analyzing SQR and Action Insight Reports to initiate new keyword, campaign, and ad group strategies and eliminate existing low-performing strategies; i.e. adding new negative keywords. I also performed ad copy analysis to discover optimizations to increase on-site engagement and CTR by recommending A/B ad copy or ad title tests to find optimal solutions. I spent a good amount of time building organized dashboards for the brands I work on, using queries pulling from DoubleClick and Google Analytics in Microsoft Excel to ensure quick and efficient monthly and quarterly reporting. Another one of my tasks included creating and uploading bulk sheets for new campaigns, ad groups, keywords, ads, sitelinks, and call-outs for easy upload into DoubleClick. Bi-weekly, I monitored competition to record new competitors entering into our brands’ landscapes and ensured the brands had high positioning and SOV. I used SEM Rush to view the paid keywords competitors were bidding on.</p>

	<h3>Digital Marketing Co-op</h3>
	<h4>September 2015 &mdash; March 2016</h4>
		<p>Urban Outfitters, Inc. is a men and women&apos;s fashion and accessories company headquartered in the Navy Yard, Philadelphia. As the Anthropologie Digital Marketing Co-op, I  assisted the email marketing team, as well as the SEO and Paid Search teams during my 6 month internship. I was responsible for steps along the lifecycle of Anthropologie&apos;s email program including calendar creation, daily reporting and analysis, and competitive monitoring. I generated weekly reports discussing and providing insights for 3-day metrics for the previous week&apos;s emails, including top products purchased, conversion rate, open rate, click-through rate, demand, etc. During the holiday season, I performed a deep-dive on Anthropologie and it&apos;s top competitors’ email imagery, design, text, and structure and presented the findings to discuss future plans and changes. Lastly, I assisted the SEO and Paid Search team by conducting keyword research using Google AdWords for new and existing products on website, updating title tags, and adding special hours on Google My Business during holiday for Anthropologie stores.</p>

		<p>Ballard Spahr, LLP is a national law firm that has over 500 lawyers across 15 offices in the United States.

I assisted the email communication team, as well as the even coordinator during my 6 month internship. My daily tasks consisted of data manipulation, analysis, and entry of data in InterAction, the firm-wide client relationship management (CRM) database. This was something I kept up with daily, as I would update contacts and email lists for the team to send out emails and publications to both internally and externally. I was also responsible for preparing monthly analytic reports on web traffic and search engine optimization for the firm&apos;s blogs and website using Google Analytics and MailChimp. I assisted the Web Editor in maintaining website content including events, alerts, press releases, speaking engagements, media coverage items, and attorney biographies using Sitecore.
